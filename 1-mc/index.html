<p>In the past, companies with strong marketing departments would dominate their industry. Their mechanism was simple: craft a beautiful campaign, iterate how associations would make someone awesome, and lastly see success. It didn’t really matter if these claims were true or even if the product itself sucked.</p>

<p>Technology however has quickly changed this status quo.  Forums, chats, blogs, etc have provided a medium where people can voice their real opinions, both positive and negative. This new-found voice has empowered dialogue not just with other consumers, but with companies who will take listening to them seriously. I’ve worked with two agencies, <a href="http://www.modernclimate.com">Modern Climate</a> and <a href="http://acclarodesign.com/">Acclaro Design</a>, attempting to do just this.</p>

    <p>The home security industry is fraught with suspicion. <em>Will this investment be reliable? Will it keep me and family safe? How does it even work?</em> Frontpoint, in its redesign, desired most of all to put their customers at ease. Its new website directly addresses its customers main concerns, namely with transparency in pricing, real life reviews, and clear security plans.</p>

    <p>My role included wireframing the "Buying Advice" section. After reading countless reviews on Frontpoint and other security companies, I realized that most customers don't understand the basics of buying a security system, but are straightaway bombarded with why x company is the best. Thus this section is designed for those who may just be starting their search or for those who need validation that their criteria is correct. It sets the groundwork of what a security system is, what the basics are, and what to look for when comparing companies. It only then discusses how Frontpoint fits the bill.</p>

    <p>LifeCare links employees to personal services. In this redesign we had two key personas: individual employees and HR professionals, and had to manage its numerous offerings for both sets of users.</p>

    <p>I mostly translated desktop into mobile and tablet wires for all pages across the site.</p>

    <p>Given that mobile views accounts for over 60 percent of Jamba Juice's website, I was asked to look at potential mobile solutions for Jamba users. After a quick heuristic evaluation of their current "Find A Location," I realized that this didn't really account for struggling sales, rather it is an incongruence with their existing users.</p>

    <p>Thus I scoured Yelp reviews nationwide and visited various locations in Minneapolis and NYC, and saw an opportunity to better serve the college population. This population already accounts for a significant amount of Jamba sales, and given its state of transition and limited funds and time are more receptive to Jamba's "Blend in the Good" messaging.</p>

    <p>This mobile solution lets college students state their need: energy for an all-nighter, glowing skin for a date, protein for post-workout and recommends a solution based on this. It also provides a bite sized scientific fact on why this drink addresses this need, reinforcing the 'good' that comes with Jamba.</p>

    This persona is largely based on Yelp reviews and behavioral psych. Jamba Juice locations on college campuses do very well.  College students, moreover, are in the midst of transition from childhood to adulthood, and it's during these periods of transitions that people change purchasing habits. How might Jamba leverage these to its advantage?

    I played with several ideas including quick informational vending machines, but was asked for a mobile solution. Here's a concept that allows students to choose what they need for that day, "energy for an all-nighter," "glowing skin for date," and drink recommendations based on this.

    <p>Merging two world-class addiction centers is difficult work. Before we could come up with a digital strategy and redesign, we first had to understand the users of both sites. Surprisingly (or unsurprisingly) addicts themselves are not the user base - it is their family who ends up dealing with the agonizing process of deciding between treatment options.</p>

    Studies have shown that peer recommendations play heavily when making decisions, both large and small. In something as personal as addiction, we wanted to look at how person-to-person contact shaped an experience.</p>
